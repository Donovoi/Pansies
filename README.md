<strong>P</strong>owershell <strong>ANSI E</strong>scape <strong>S</strong>equences

This module contains classes and functions for doing ANSI colored output and positioning using Virtual Terminal escape sequences on platforms where they are supported: Windows 10, Linux, OS X, etc.


NOTE: We will make _some_ attempt to support older versions of PowerShell and Windows running in ConEmu with ANSI support, but it's not a priority.

For an example of what you can do with this at this early stage (including a Get-ColorGradient which I'll move to this module later), see [my Figlet module](/Jaykul/Figlet)!
